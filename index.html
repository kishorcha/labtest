        <p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
            attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such
            as
            hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and
            aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the
            humanâ€“canine
            bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
            "man's best friend".[14]</p>

        <p>
        <h2>Differnt types of breeds in the dog</h2>
        Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.[10] In the Victorian
        era,
        directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.[8] Most
        breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years,[8][10] and since then dogs have
        undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed
        by
        humans.

        <p>
            The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more
            phenotypic
            diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits
            related
            to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.[8] Their
            behavioural
            traits include guarding, herding, and hunting,[8] retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits
            include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression

        <h3 class="ct">Cat</h3>
        <img src="./beautiful-cats-y4upwj5zz45novpx.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated
            species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it
            from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or
            feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for
            companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
            registries.[6]</p>
        <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year
            in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9][10] Domestic cats are
            bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of
            cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
            resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal,
            and reptile species.[11]</p>
